# Task 2 - Machine Learning Model for Telemetry Data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`task_2_model_new.ipynb`) that processes **telemetry data**, calculates distances, and builds a **machine learning model** for predicting outcomes based on vehicle movement.

## üìå **Project Overview**
This project involves:
- **Loading and preprocessing telemetry data**
- **Calculating cumulative distances for vehicle movement**
- **Extracting useful features from path data**
- **Building and evaluating a machine learning model**

## üìÇ **Files in this Repository**
- `task_2_model_new.ipynb` - The main Jupyter Notebook implementing the data processing and ML model.
- `processed_Input_A1_1.csv` - The telemetry dataset.
- `Solution_first_lap_equidistant.csv` - Path data for distance calculations.
- `requirements.txt` - A list of required dependencies.

üõ† Steps Performed in the Notebook

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load and Clean the Telemetry Data
The dataset processed_Input_A1_1.csv is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Missing values are dropped.
The column "fuel capacity" is removed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Load and Process Path Data
The dataset Solution_first_lap_equidistant.csv is loaded.
A function calculate_path_distances(df) calculates the cumulative distance traveled.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Distance Metrics
A function calculate_distance(p1, p2) calculates the Euclidean distance between two 3D points.
Another function calculate_cumulative_distance(telemetry) computes the total distance covered by the vehicle over time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
The dataset is transformed to extract meaningful features for modeling.
Important columns are selected based on movement data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Train a Machine Learning Model
The target variable is identified.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Random Forest model (or another ML model) is trained on the processed data.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R¬≤ Score
Feature Importance Analysis
Performance is visualized using plots.
